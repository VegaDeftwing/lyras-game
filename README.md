# Lyra's Game
The mental health of my friends and family- living and not- have inspired me to
make a game about the struggles of living with depression, disaccosiation, and
other mental health conditions as well as just generally being different and the
social struggles that go along with being in any group

Undertale, doki-doki lit. club, rogue, zork, have all influnced the game as well
as countless real life experiances and other media- from books like Eragon and
Ready Player One to TV shows like Supernatual and Sherlock. This game is part of
me and a part of everything I've ever done or experianced. It is the product of
countless hours staring at documentation and working with friends to come up with ideas.
Enjoy.
